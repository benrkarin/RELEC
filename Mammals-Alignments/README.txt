RELEC Mammal Alignments

The mammal alignments were generated from two sources:
1. (150 loci) Downloaded directly from the OrthoMam database (http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/).
	These are orthologous, single copy exons and can be directly used for probe design.
2. (22 Loci) Extracted and realigned from the ENSEMBL ortholog panel. These are intronless 
	protein-coding sequences and therefore we have not confirmed intron-exon boundaries in these. 
	Therefore, use caution and reconfirm intron-exon boundaries within your focal group if using 
	these to design probes.

All loci do not contain all taxa, I believe this is mostly due to genome incompleteness 
rather than gene deletion.
